Title: Quest for the optimal algorithm

Talk description:
Algorithm development is often a messy process, much of which never makes it
into the publication. This talk goes behind the scenes and traces the ongoing
development of ever more efficient algorithms for the Gene Team Tree problem.
We will end with an open data structure problem needed for a faster algorithm
and a collaborative problem solving session.

Pre-talk preparation tips or instructions:
Below is the open data structure problem that we will be discussing.

Input is a list, P, of n points on the number line in increasing order, 
[p_1, p_2, ..., p_n]. 

The gap between two adjacent points p_i and p_i+1 is the distance between
them, i.e. p_i+1 - p_i. 

The max gap of P is max (p_i+1 - p_i) for i from 1 to n-1. 

Design a data structure for P that supports a single operation delete(p), which
deletes point p from P and return the max gap of P. Assume we have a direct
reference to the point p so there is no need to search for it.
a) perform n deletions in O(n lg n) time (solved)
b) perform n deletions in O(n) time (open)
